# What does the functor do on the tree?

<!-- 
![bg blur:5px brightness:0.5](./img/path-dog1.jpg)

# Path for today

1) Model a `Tree` with `ADT`
 * what is a tree
 * normal people see birds or cats on trees
 * our trees are upside down
 * and if we have a really close look, we can see a functor on them
2) Identify the `Functor` on the `Tree`
3) Everyday `Tree` in IT
 * Source code
 * Filesystem and the `tree` command
4) Drawing our own tree
 * Goal: draw a timeline of WSUG
   * First just edition names + times
   * Then subtrees with topics and authors
   * Then sub-subtrees with author details like website or socials
 * Depth first - functional approach
 * Breadth-first - imperative
 * Compile it together
 * Homework: Okasaki structure for FP breadth-first -->

# Let's model this

# Tree

<!-- _class: line-numbers -->

```scala
enum Tree[A]:
  case Branch(value: A, xbranches: NonEmptyList[Tree[A]])
  case Leaf(value: A)
```

# Now what?

How's that useful?

# Programming languages ðŸŒ³

The compiler parses your text file and produces an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

- Allow you to analyze and manipulate the syntactic structure of programs
- Useful in meta-programming

# AST

# Databases ðŸŒ³

Self-balancing tree called *B-tree* is a popular way to implement indexing in databases

# File system ðŸŒ³

- `/` is the `Root`
- Directories are branches
- Files are leaves

How about we implement a renderer like this for our tree?
